\section{Work Plan}

In the following months, the first version of the applications is planned to be accomplished according to the use cases defined in the chapter III. 
The development, as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:figure1}, will be structured in 6 two week long sprints, with 2 contingicy week. One between the sprint 3 and 4 and another after sprint 6, in case of delays on some tasks.

The Sprint 1 will be dedicated to the integration with the LightMobie System and the development of the Receptionist Use Cases, as seen below: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Integration with the Sytem;
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Start Date: 24/01/2025 
      \item End Date: 27/01/2025 
  \end{itemize}
    \item Receptionist use Cases;
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Start Date: 28/01/2025 
        \item End Date: 06/02/2025 
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

In the Sprint 2, the development of the first five Use Cases of the mechanic is planned as follow:  

\begin{itemize}
  \item Mechanic Use cases 2.1 - 2.5;
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Start Date: 07/02/2025 
      \item End Date: 20/02/2025 
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The Sprint 3 will be dedicated to the last two Use Cases of the mechanic:  

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Mechanic Use Cases 2.6 and 2.7;
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Start Date: 21/02/2025 
      \item End Date: 06/03/2025 
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The following week is reserved for the contingicy, so in the case of no delay, the Sprint 4 is succeeding.
In the Sprint 4, the Admin Use Cases from 4.3 to 4.5 are planned. The 4.1 and 4.2 were skipped to further weeks, since they are related to the Warehouse Use Cases.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Admin Use Cases 4.3 - 4.5;
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Start Date: 14/03/2025 
      \item End Date: 27/03/2025 
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The Sprint 5 is expected to the development of the remaining two Admin Use Cases and the Warehouse Use Cases.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Admin Use Cases 4.1 and 4.2;
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Start Date: 28/03/2025 
    \item End Date: 06/04/2025 
  \end{itemize}
  \item Warehouse Use Cases;
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Start Date: 07/04/2025 
    \item End Date: 10/04/2025 
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The final sprint, the Sprint 6, it will be reserved to developing the client application Use Cases.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Client App Use Case;
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Start Date: 11/04/2025  
    \item End Date: 24/05/2025 
  \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
The following week is reserved for another contingicy.

  Following the development of the applications, another two weeks are foreseen to conduct a user testing, to apply the notes and suggestion of the experiment and code improvements.
  The remaining time will be used to finish writing the dissertation, primarly the results and conclusion.
  
  The literature will accompany all of this proccess, since it may appear another paper or study that may be relevant to the work.
