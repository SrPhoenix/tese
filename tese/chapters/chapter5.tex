\section{User tests}

To test the aplication i decided to create user tests for each application.
The test consist of a single or multiple tasks that the user needed to perform or a sequence of question the user needed to answer.
After a user finish the tests of an aplication he answers a questionair to avaliate the aplication.
Each application has the same questionair seen in \ref and the user tests can be seen in \ref. 
In this test i search to envolve the requirements and important features of the application.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Rececionist}

The results of the tests can be seen in \ref.
By observing the users i saw that overall the tasks were easily accomplish without issues, except the task 6 - maintenance approval. 
The users coudn't find the form to accomplish the task and required my help to localize it. 

From the feedback of the users i discovered some bugs and points where the application was less user friendly and also some limitations.
The principal issue was the need to close the modals of the maintenance approval and maintenance details change to get information about the dealership occupation.
Other issue was the task filter on the maintenance schedule modal. 
It was working by when clicking on a mechanic remove the filter if the filter was on. 
The users suggest to remove the filter of the other mechanics and only revealing the tasks of the chosen one.
The last suggestion was to merge the modal of actions with the maintenance details. 


\subsection{workshop Manager}

The results of the tests can be seen in \ref.

The users were able to finish all tasks without help, but they noted some issues on the filter of the maintenance history statistics that was fixed on a later date.
They also suggest to clear the forms of employee creation and purchase assign after the operation.


\subsection{Mechanic}

The results of the tests can be seen in \ref.

The user in this test did not required any help and could complete the task without any issue.
They noted that the step by step approach to display the tasks was not recommended and a page displaying all the task would be more apresentable.


\subsection{Warehouse Operator}

The results of the tests can be seen in \ref.

The users were also able to complete the tasks easily but suggest than in the modal to create a purchase to allow the search the parts by writing on the keyboard instead of simple select.
\subsection{Client}

The results of the tests can be seen in \ref.

The users were also able to complete the tasks easily but noted when the tasks ended the empty page could be salvage by showing the contacts of the nearby dealerships.
