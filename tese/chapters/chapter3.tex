\section{Applications Workflow}

After the development of the use cases, a flow chart was designed to understand the users' interaction with the system and each other. The chart is visible in figure \ref{fig:figure2}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Use Case Flow Chart of the Client, Receptionist, Mechanic, Warehouse Operator, and Administrator.}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/UseCaseDiagram2}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

The system's main flow starts when a Client arrives at the dealership for vehicle maintenance. 
The receptionist gets some input from the client and decides on an initial budget and check-out date agreed with him and inserts the information in the system (Use Case 1.1).
After that, a worker will be responsible for doing the analysis of the vehicle. 
He will add to the system all the problems he finds and the necessary parts that need to be replaced (Use Case 2.2 and 2.3).


If the budget to complete the work or the expected time changes, an alert is sent to the receptionist to inform the Client (Use Case 1.4). 
The result of this interaction must be "authorize the changes and continue the work", "not authorize the changes but continue as initially agreed" or "not authorizing the changes and wanting to check out the vehicle".
In the last case, the vehicle is delivered and the app will request the client to rate the service (Use Case 1.2 and 5.3). 
In any other case, the maintenance process continues. The only difference is the maintenance process information is alterated in the not authorized case.

After this step, the admin will receive a notification of the new tasks and will assign them to each worker (Use Case 4.5).
From there on, the maintenance process can or can not require the need for a vehicle part to be replaced. 
In the negative case the vehicle goes to the responsible mechanic to do the oil change, tire change, wash, etc (Use Case 2.6). 
In the affirmative case, the Warehouse Operator will check if the parts the mechanic requested are available in stock. 
If it does, the operator accepts the request and delivers the parts to the mechanic, who will replace the parts of the vehicle, deliver the damaged parts to the warehouse, and do the maintenance (Use Case 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6). 
If it does not, the operator needs to buy new parts from the supplier. 
In this case, he initiates a new requesting purchase that can be authorized by the admin. 
In the optimal case, the admin accepts the purchase, the operator buys the new parts, registers them in the system, and delivers them to the mechanic. 
In the worst scenario, the admin rejects the purchase and the mechanic needs to request new parts and restart the process (Use Case 2.3).    

Finally, when the vehicle maintenance is finished, the mechanic inserts into the system all operations and tests carried out as well as their results (Use Case 2.7). 
At once, the system notifies the customer that the vehicle is ready for the check out and, when the receptionist delivers the vehicle to the Customer, the client application asks to rate the system (Use Case 5.2, 1.2 and 5.3).

There are also a few secondary flows visible in the figure \ref{fig:figure2}. 
These flows are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The client enters the application to check the status of the maintenance (Use case 5.1);
  \item The mechanic enters the application to view the task he has to do (Use Case 2.1); 
  \item The Warehouse Operator enters the application to visualize the diverse parts and components in the warehouse (Use case 3.1); 
  \item The Admin enters the application to assign roles and/or permissions to the employees (Use Case 4.4); 
  \item The Admin enters the application to gather information about a maintenance performed and see statistics about that information (Use Case 4.2 and 4.3); 
\end{itemize}
 



\section{Database} 


\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Database general diagram.}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/dbDiagrams/DbDiagramFull}
  \label{fig:figure2} 
\end{figure}

In this section i will describe the dabase structure i create to solve this problem.
To solve this problem i create a structure that devides in 5 sections:
- Maintenance \& Tasks
- Parts \& Inventory 
- Purchasing
- Services
- Vehicles \& Owners
- Users
 

\subsection{Users} 

The section users was provided by the ligthmobie's dabase structure and i used it to create users, create the roles of the users and create the group of users (client, rececionist, warehouse manager,...).



\subsection{Maintenance and Tasks} 


\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Database Maintenance and Tasks diagram.}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/dbDiagrams/Maintenance_and_Tasks}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

To save the information about the maintenance i created a table called the "Maintenance". This table has the following columns:
- ClientId, which is a foreign key to the AspNetUsers Table and is the table that has the information about the users of the platform.
- OwnerId, which is a foreign key to the Owners table and represents the dealership that is providing the maintenance
- VehicleId, the vehicle that is going to do the maintenance
- ClientEntityId, Optional column that connects to the Owner of a bike sharing system
- CreatedDate, that is the date of creation of the maintenance
- EvalDate, date of the evaluation date of the vehicle
- AnomalyIdentification, is a text describing the problem with the vehicle
- AnomalyCause, is a text describing the cause of the problem with the vehicle
- ClientNotes, is a text describing additional information provided by the client
- ConclusionDateExpected, is the expectedd date of the end of the maintenance agreed with the client, used to control the expectation of client for the duration of the maintenance 
- ConclusionDate, the actual date of the end of the maintenance
- DeliverDate, the date of the deliver of the vehicle to the client
- BudgetExpected, the expected budget of the maintenance agreed with the client, used to control the expectation of client for the price of the maintenance 
- Budget, the actual price of the maintenance
- ClientScoreExpected, the score of the quality of the service expected by the client
- ClientScore, the score of the quality of the service perceived by the client
- WorkHoursExpected, the number of hours expected to conclude the maintenance
- WorkHours, the number of hours to conclude the maintenance
- StatusId, the status of the maintenance. It can be WaitEvaluation, the status before the evaluation of the vehicle; waitApproval, after the evaluation of the vehicle and before the client and rececionist decide which tasks should be done, the budget of the expected budget of the maintenance and the expected conclusion date; DuringMaintenance, the status when the tasks of the maintenance are being completed; MaintenanceFinished, after all the tasks of the maintenance are completed; Delivered, when the vehicle is delivered to the client; Canceled, when the client decides to cancel the maintenance and retrieve the vehicle as it is

The maintenance is connected to the MaintenanceChange table. This table is used to save the information when a change in the maintenance occurr, like the expected conclusion date change, a task changed or the expected budget changed.
This table has the following columns:
- MaintenanceId, the identification of the maintenance which is being changed
- CreatedDate, the date of the change
- NewBudget, the new expected budget
- MinConclusionDate, the earleast date to complete the maintenance. This columns is important if, for example a part delivery is late and may only arrive on a date after the expected conclusion date.
- NewConclusionDate, the new expected conclusion date agreed with the client
- Status, the status of the maintenanceChange. It may be AskClient, when the maintenance change needs the valiation of the client; Agreed, when the client accept the changes; Refused, when the changes are refused and the maintenance keeps the same information and the previous agreement; TaskCanceled, when the client decides to cancel the task that provokes the maintenance change; MaintenanceCanceled, when the client decides to terminated the maintenance as it is.
- VehiclePartTypeId, the new part of the vehicle that from the maintenance task that is being changed
