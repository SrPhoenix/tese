\section{Applications Workflow}

After the development of the use cases, a flow chart was designed to understand the users' interaction with the system and each other. The chart is visible in figure \ref{fig:figure2}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Use Case Flow Chart of the Client, Receptionist, Mechanic, Warehouse Operator, and Administrator.}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/UseCaseDiagram - General}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

The system's main flow starts when a Client arrives at the dealership for vehicle maintenance. 
The receptionist gets some input from the client and decides on an initial budget and check-out date agreed with him and inserts the information in the system (Use Case 1.1).
After that, a worker will be responsible for doing the analysis of the vehicle. 
He will add to the system all the problems he finds and the necessary parts that need to be replaced (Use Case 2.2 and 2.3).


If the budget to complete the work or the expected time changes, an alert is sent to the receptionist to inform the Client (Use Case 1.4). 
The result of this interaction must be "authorize the changes and continue the work", "not authorize the changes but continue as initially agreed" or "not authorizing the changes and wanting to check out the vehicle".
In the last case, the vehicle is delivered and the app will request the client to rate the service (Use Case 1.2 and 5.3). 
In any other case, the maintenance process continues. The only difference is the maintenance process information is alterated in the not authorized case.

After this step, the admin will receive a notification of the new tasks and will assign them to each worker (Use Case 4.5).
From there on, the maintenance process can or can not require the need for a vehicle part to be replaced. 
In the negative case the vehicle goes to the responsible mechanic to do the oil change, tire change, wash, etc (Use Case 2.6). 
In the affirmative case, the Warehouse Operator will check if the parts the mechanic requested are available in stock. 
If it does, the operator accepts the request and delivers the parts to the mechanic, who will replace the parts of the vehicle, deliver the damaged parts to the warehouse, and do the maintenance (Use Case 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6). 
If it does not, the operator needs to buy new parts from the supplier. 
In this case, he initiates a new requesting purchase that can be authorized by the admin. 
In the optimal case, the admin accepts the purchase, the operator buys the new parts, registers them in the system, and delivers them to the mechanic. 
In the worst scenario, the admin rejects the purchase and the mechanic needs to request new parts and restart the process (Use Case 2.3).    

Finally, when the vehicle maintenance is finished, the mechanic inserts into the system all operations and tests carried out as well as their results (Use Case 2.7). 
At once, the system notifies the customer that the vehicle is ready for the check out and, when the receptionist delivers the vehicle to the Customer, the client application asks to rate the system (Use Case 5.2, 1.2 and 5.3).

There are also a few secondary flows visible in the figure \ref{fig:figure2}. 
These flows are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The client enters the application to check the status of the maintenance (Use case 5.1);
  \item The mechanic enters the application to view the task he has to do (Use Case 2.1); 
  \item The Warehouse Operator enters the application to visualize the diverse parts and components in the warehouse (Use case 3.1); 
  \item The Admin enters the application to assign roles and/or permissions to the employees (Use Case 4.4); 
  \item The Admin enters the application to gather information about a maintenance performed and see statistics about that information (Use Case 4.2 and 4.3); 
\end{itemize}
 

\section{Status} 

With the flow talked in the previous section, it was needed to create multiple status of system.
- The maintenance status: the status of a maintenance
- The maintenance change status: the status when occurs a change on the maintenance like the conclusion date was changed or the budget.
- The maintenance task status: the status of a mechanic task.
- The purchase status: the status when the dealership purchase new parts
- The owner partnership status: when a bike sharing entity wants to associate with the dealership to provide maintenance of theres vehicles

\subsection{Maintenance} 


\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Status flow chart of a maintenance}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/Maintenance/StatusDiagram}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}


When occurr a maintenance it is divided in 6 status as seen in the figure above:
- Wait Evaluation: the inicial status when the vehicle is waiting to be analysed by the mechanic
- Wait Approval: the status where the tasks choosen by the mechanic need to be approved by the client, as well as the budget and the conclusion date
- During Maintenance: the status when the tasks of the maintenance are being done
- Maintenance Finished: after all the tasks of the maintenance are completed
- Delivered: when the vehicle is delivered to the client
- Canceled: when the client decides to cancel the maintenance and retrieve the vehicle as it is


\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Use case flow chart of dealership normal maintenance. With the status grouped by the use cases}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/Maintenance/UseCaseStatus}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

In the figure above we can see how this status is divided in the flow of the use case of a maintenance in a dealership.
The flow starts with the "Wait Evaluation" status when the client contacts the rececionist to schedule a new maintenance. Then this status is hold with the assign of the evaluation task and the execution of the task by the mechanic.
When the task is done, the maintenance pass to the "Wait Approval" status where the rececionist contacts the client to confirm which tasks he decides to use in the maintenance as well as the budget and the conclusion date of the maintenance.
After the client decides which tasks he wants to keep and which he doesnt the maintenance pass to the status "During maintenance", where it keeps it until the end of the last task. Until this point the client can contact the rececionist to cancel the maintenance and pass to the status "Canceled", where the client can rate the service provided.
After the maintenance is finished, the maintenance pass to the stastus "Maintenance Finished" where the client is notified with the conclusion of the maintenance and the vehicle is delivered. After the vehicle is delivered, the maintenace pass to the status "Delivered" and the client may rate the service.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Use case flow chart of a entity with maintenance of theres vehicles. With the status grouped by the use cases}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/Maintenance/EntityDiagram}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

When the entity doing the maintenance also provides a bike sharing system, the maintenance may be more efficient.
In that case there is a flow of the system more simplified.
First a rececionist or another employee enconters a problem in a vehicle and schedules a maintenance with the rececionist. In this situation the maintenance is in "Wait Evaluation" status until the evaluation is carried out like the previous flow.
The diference in this flow is, during the evaluation the mechanic is not going to say which task is needed to be performed on the vehicle, he says which tasks he done during the evaluation to complete the maintenance, so the maintenance of the vehicle pass to the "Maintenance Finished" status.
Since this maintenance doesn't have a client the client is not notified so but when the vehicle leaves the workshop to the redistributors to the be used, it pass to the "Delivered" state.  


\subsection{Maintenance Change} 


\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Status flow chart of a maintenance Change}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/MaintenanceChange/StatusDiagram}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}


When occurr a maintenance change the client needs to be notified and this flow has the following status, as seen in the figure above:
- AskClient, The inicial status when the maintenance change needs to be confirmed by the client
- Agreed, when the client accept the changes
- Refused, when the changes are refused and the maintenance keeps the same information and the previous agreement; 
- TaskCanceled, when the client decides to cancel the task that provokes the maintenance change
- MaintenanceCanceled, when the client decides to terminated the maintenance as it is.



\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Use case flow chart of a maintenance change divided by the multiple status of the maintenance change}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/MaintenanceChange/UseCaseStatus}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

In the figure above we can see how this status is divided in the flow of the use case of a maintenance change.
First a change is made in the maintenance and the rececionist is notified to contact the client, at this time the status s "Ask Client".
After contacting the client and explaining the situation the rececionist have this option depending on the will of the client:
- Agreed, when the client accept the changes
- Refused, when the changes are refused and the maintenance keeps the same information and the previous agreement; 
- TaskCanceled, when the client decides to cancel the task that provokes the maintenance change
- MaintenanceCanceled, when the client decides to terminated the maintenance as it is.

\subsection{Maintenance Task} 


\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Status flow chart of a task}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/MaintenanceTask/StatusDiagram}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}


In the figure above we can see how this status is divided in the flow of the use case of a task.
- WaitApproval: The inicial state when the task is created and before the approval from the client.
- WaitAssignment: The state when a task is approved by the client and has no needed parts or the parts needed are on the warehouse. 
- Invalid: When a task is rejected by the client
- Assigned: When a ready task is a assigned to a mechanic
- Concluded: When a mechanic finish concluding the task
- Changed: When the mechanic notes a problem during the task and suggest a change that requires the validation from the client
- WaitPart: When the task is aproved by the client but needs parts to be completed that are not in the inventory.



\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Use case flow chart of a task divided by the multiple status of the task}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/MaintenanceTask/UseCaseStatus}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

In the figure above we can see the flow of a maintenance task during a maintenance.
The flow may start with two states, the "Wait Approval" or with the "Concluded".
On the case of a bikesharing system with maintenance of there own vehicle, the mechanic during the evaluation it completes the tasks that he registers so this tasks added to the system start at the state concluded.
At a dealership, a task from a maintenance with a client starts with the workshop manager adding a new task or during the evaluation of the maintenance.
In this time the task is in the status "Wait Approval". Then the task needs to be validated by the client. 
If it is invalidated it takes the status "Invalid" and the task flow ends here. If the task is approved, the system checks if it needs parts to be completed and if the task are available in the warehouse.
If the task need the parts and they are not available, the flow stops in the state "Wait part". After that, the system verifies if the task is assigned to a user. 
If it is not, the task holds in the state "Wait Assignment", until the workshop manager assigns a mechanic. Then, it goes to the state "Assigned", where the mechanic executes the task.
If the mechanic does not find any problens, the task is finished and goes to the state "Concluded" ending the flow. If the mechanic finds that the chosen part is not apropriate to this vehicle, he can suggest a new part to complete the task and the task goes to the state "Changed".
After this, the client needs to approve this change and the flow repeats after "Wait Approval" state.


\subsection{Purchase} 



\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Status flow chart of a purchase}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/Purchase/StatusDiagram}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}


When occurr a purchase the workshop manager needs to be notified and the flow has the following status, as seen in the figure above:
- WaitApproval: The inicial state when the purchase request needs to be approved by the workshop manager
- Invalid: When the workshop manager rejects a purchase request
- Assigned: When the purchase request was approved by the workshop manager and assigned to a warehouse operator
- WaitArrival: After the operator assigned to the purchase contacts the supplier to request the purchase
- Finished: When the parts arrive at the dealership and are registered into the system


\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Use case flow chart of a purchase divided by the multiple status of the purchase}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/Purchase/UseCaseStatus}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

In the figure above we can see how this status is divided in the flow of the use case of a purchase.
The flow starts when the operator (or the system) makes a purchase request. This request has the state "Wait Approval" untils the workshop manager authorize (or not) the request.
If the workshop manager rejects the request, the purchase request keeps with the status "Invalid" and the flow ends here. If the purchase is authorized, purchase passes to the status "Assigned".
After the request is authorized, the warehouse operator assigned to the purchase contacts the supplier to get the parts of the request.
After that, he introduces the expected date of the Arrival of the parts and the request pass to the status "Wait Arrival".
When the parts arrive at the dealership the operator register the parts and the purchase pass to the status "Finished"


\subsection{Owner Partnership} 



\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Status flow chart of a partnership}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/OwnerPartnership_StatusDiagram}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

when a entity wants to do a partnership with a dealership to allow him to do the maintenance of theres vehicle the flow is follow by the figure above:
- Request: the workshop manager is notified that a new entity wants to do a partnership with the dealership
- Accept, the dealership is allow to see the information about the vehicles of that entity and schedule maintenance for its vehicles
- Denied, the request was denied

The Owner table registers the information of the dealerships and bike sharing entities.
The vehicle table registers the information of each vehicle and is connected with the vehicleType thar stores the type of vehicles, like "Eletric bikes", "convention bikes", etc.

I created the table OwnerVehicleType to allow disinguish between dealership availability to do a maintenance to specific type of vehicles. This table only has the column of connection of the two tables, owner and vehicleType.
The OwnerPartnership table is used to allow bikesharing entities to share information with dealership for it to do the maintenance. If a dealership is not connected to a bike sharing entity is not allowed to view theres vehicle information.
This table has the following columns:

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Rececionist view}
The rececionist application view has only one page seen in \ref .

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Rececionist home page.}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Implementation/rececionist/rececionistHomePage}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

In this page it is visible a bar chart with the expected working hours of each mechanic for the days of the selected week.
The mechanic can navegate through out the year using the buttons "próxima semana" e "semana anterior" to go to the next and previous week respectively.
This information is relevant to understand which mechanic is available to do a vehicle evaluation and accomplish the Use Case 1.1 – Maintenance Schedule.
To schedule a maintenance a rececionist has two options: click on the green button "Adicionar Tarefa" or click on the graph on the specific date he wants to choose.
Both options will open up a modal seen in figure \ref.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Rececionist schedule maintenance.}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Implementation/rececionist/addTask}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

In the modal, the rececionist can still change the date of the maintenance in the top lef corner and it will show the tasks of the mechanics of that date, including the name of the task and the expected time to complete that task.
To finish the schedule of the maintenance, the rececionist must fill the form on the right side of the modal.
The options are:
- The name of the entity: it is optional and it is refers to a bikesharing entity that has a partnership relational with the dealership;
- the vehicle registration: it is mandatory and it refers to the vehicle registration of the vehicle, it only accepts vehicles from partner entities or from users without entity; this field has autocompletes
- the client email: it is mandatory and it refers email of the client, if the client doesn't exist it is created a new client for that account, and an email is sent to that user to finish the account creation;  if the user exist and is related to a partner entity or is a solo client, the email can be autocompleted;
- the hours of the vehicle arrival: it is mandatory and it refers to the agreed time when the client will bring the vehicle
- pre-selected tasks: it is optional and it refers to tasks that the rececionist may already add to the maintenance as the will of the client; it has a price tag below to indicate the expected price of the maintenance with those pre-selected tasks
- adicional notes: it is optional and it refers to notes that the rececionist may want to pass to the mechanic responsible for the vehicle evaluation
Finally the rececionist clicks on the button "Criar" to finish the maintenance shedule and complete the use case 1.1 – Maintenance Schedule.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Implementation/rececionist/activeMaintenances}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

When clicking on the button "Manutenções Ativas" on the menu it shows an offcanvas with the list of non finished maintenances, as seen in \ref.
This button can have a red circle with a number that represents the number of maintenances that has a maintenance change and needs the rececionist to contact the client.
In the offcanvas, each card has the information to identify the maintenance and indicate the progress, namely:
- the vehicle registration: the registration number of the vehicle that is doing the maintenance
- the entity: the name of the entity of the vehicle
- the expected conclusion date: the expected date to conclude the maintenance
- the progress of the maintenance: the percentage of tasks completed
In each maintenance card may be seen a red circle in the top right corner with a number. 
This represents the number of maintenance changes for that maintenance, like, for example a task is delayed and another has a part change suggestion.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Active maintenance details Information tab.}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Implementation/rececionist/maintenance_details}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}


When clicking on "Ver Detalhes" of a maintenance it opens a modal as seen in the figure \ref.
In this modal has the information that the rececionist may need to answer the client if the client calls to ask for it.
With this the Use Case 1.3 – Collect information about a maintenance request is completed.
The information shared in the modal, namely in the "Information" tab is:
- Vehicle registration
- Entity name
- Creation date of the maintenance
- Evaluation date of the vehicle
- Expected conclusion date
- Expected budget
- Expected Working Hours 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Active maintenance details task tab.}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Implementation/rececionist/maintenance_details_task}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

When navigating to the "Tarefa" tab it shows the tasks selected by the evaluation on the left side and the status of the task on the right side.
On the left side, for each task it shows:
- the price 
- the number of hours to complete
- the name of the part to complete the task
On the right side, for each task shows the status that can be:
- Invalid, represented as a red cross
- completed, represented as a green check
