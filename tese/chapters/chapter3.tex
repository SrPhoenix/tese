\label{chapter:requirementsAnalysis}

\begin{introduction}
This chapter defines the specification of the proposed system, combining insights from meetings with Lightmobie, EMEL, and the literature. It begins with the requirements, organized by the FURPS model and extended with functional and system constraints. Then, the use cases and workflow are presented to illustrate how each role interacts with the system and how information flows during maintenance. Finally, a set of statuses is introduced to track the progress of each service request, ensuring transparency and consistency throughout the process.
\end{introduction} 




\section{Application Requirements}
The requirements for the application were defined based on insights gathered from multiple sources. These include meetings with stakeholders from Lightmobie and EMEL, as well as findings from the literature review. To structure and classify these requirements, the FURPS model was adopted, which organizes them into functional and non-functional categories.

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
The non-functional requirements of the system were defined according to the FURPS model and are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:nfr}. These requirements ensure that, \textbf{beyond providing the necessary functionalities}, the system also delivers high levels of quality, performance, and maintainability.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Requirement} \\ \hline
Scalability & The system must be capable of supporting users across Europe. \\ \hline
Reliability & The system must ensure at least 99\% availability and be able to recover from failures within 4 hours. \\ \hline
Performance & The system's response time must not exceed 2 seconds. \\ \hline
Usability & Training a new user to effectively use the system should take no longer than 8 hours. \\ \hline
Supportability & The system must be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. \\ \hline
\end{tabular} 
\label{tab:nfr}

\section{Applications Workflow}

To provide a clear view of how users interact both with the system and with each other, a workflow diagram was created based on the defined use cases. The overall application workflow is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:appWorkflow}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Use case flow chart of the Client, Receptionist, Mechanic, Warehouse Operator, and Workshop Manager.}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/UseCaseDiagram - General}
  \label{fig:appWorkflow}
\end{figure}

The main workflow begins when a client arrives at the dealership to request a vehicle maintenance. The receptionist records the request and registers this information in the system (Use Case 1.1). Once the request is created, a mechanic evaluates the vehicle, identifies problems, and specifies the necessary replacement parts (Use Case 2.2).

After this evaluation, the receptionist contacts the client to present the results. At this stage, both parties agree on the final maintenance plan, including the tasks to be performed, the expected delivery date, and the associated costs (Use Case 1.2). The client also provides an initial evaluation of the expected service quality on the client app (Use Case 5.4). When the plan is confirmed, the workshop manager receives a notification of the tasks and assigns them to the appropriate mechanics (Use Case 4.1).

From this point onward, the execution of the tasks may or may not require replacement parts. If no parts are needed, the mechanic performs the assigned maintenance (Use Case 2.6). If parts are required, the warehouse operator verifies stock availability. When the parts are available, they are delivered to the mechanic (Use Case 2.4). If they are not available, the operator submits a purchase request that must be approved by the workshop manager. If approved, the operator proceeds to order the parts (Use Case 3.3), register them in the system (Use Case 3.4), and deliver them to the mechanic. If the purchase request is rejected, the operator must restart the process with a new request (Use Case 3.2).

During the course of the maintenance, unexpected events may occur. A delivery delay (Use Case 3.6) or a task modification identified by the mechanic (Use Case 2.5) may affect the budget or the expected completion time. In such cases, the receptionist informs the client and requests a decision. The client may authorize the changes and allow the work to continue (Use Case 1.4), reject the changes while maintaining the original agreement (Use Case 1.5), refuse the changes but authorize the completion of the remaining approved tasks (Use Case 1.8), or cancel the maintenance entirely (Use Case 1.7). If the last option is chosen, all remaining tasks are invalidated, and the vehicle is prepared for check-out (Use Case 5.3).

When the maintenance tasks are completed, the system notifies the client that the vehicle is ready. The receptionist delivers the vehicle to the client (Use Case 1.6), after which the client is prompted by the application to rate the service (Use Cases 5.2 and 5.3).


\section{System Statuses} 

\subsection{Maintenance status} 

In order to ensure transparency and consistency during the maintenance process, it is important to track the overall progress of each service request through a set of predefined statuses. These statuses provide a structured view of the workflow, from the initial vehicle evaluation to its final delivery, while also capturing critical decision points that may alter the course of the process.

These are the \textit{maintenance status} key stages of this workflow:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Wait Evaluation}: Inicial status when the vehicle is waiting to be inspected by the mechanic.
    \item \textbf{Wait Approval}: The mechanic has proposed tasks that require the client's approval.
    \item \textbf{During Maintenance}: Approved tasks are actively being executed by the workshop.
    \item \textbf{Maintenance Finished}: All tasks have either been completed or invalidated.
    \item \textbf{Delivered}: The vehicle is returned to the client after maintenance conclusion.
    \item \textbf{Canceled}: The client cancels the maintenance process mid-workflow.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Status flow chart of a maintenance workflow}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/Maintenance/StatusDiagram}
  \label{fig:maintenanceFlowChart}
\end{figure}

The status transitions represented in \ref{maintenanceFlowChart} outline how the workflow evolves over time:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Wait Evaluation} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Wait Approval}: After the mechanic completes the initial evaluation.
    \item \textbf{Wait Approval} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{During Maintenance}: Once the client approves the proposed tasks and budget.
    \item \textbf{During Maintenance} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Maintenance Finished}: When all approved tasks are completed.
    \item \textbf{Maintenance Finished} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Delivered}: The vehicle is handed back to the client.
    \item Any status $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Canceled}: If the client decides to cancel the maintenance process.
    \item \textbf{Wait Evaluation} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Maintenance Finished}: If the dealership skips the evaluation step and the mechanic completes all tasks directly.
\end{itemize}

In the figure \ref{maintenanceUseCaseStatus} and \ref{maintenanceDealershipUseCaseStatus} we can see how these status are divided in the use case flow of the application.

To further clarify how these statuses operate in practice, \ref{maintenanceUseCaseStatus} and \ref{maintenanceDealershipUseCaseStatus} illustrate their use within two different contexts: a dealership providing standard maintenance services and an entity managing maintenance without evaluation.


\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Use case flow chart of dealership maintenance, with statuses grouped by use cases}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/Maintenance/UseCaseStatus}
  \label{fig:maintenanceUseCaseStatus}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Use case flow chart of an entity managing maintenance without evaluation, with statuses grouped by use cases}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/Maintenance/EntityDiagram}
  \label{fig:maintenanceDealershipUseCaseStatus}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Maintenance Change Status} 

During the course of maintenance, situations may arise that require modifications to the originally planned tasks or agreements. To manage this process effectively, the workflow is modeled through a set of statuses that capture the client's decision and define the subsequent path of action. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ask Client}: Initial status when a maintenance change is identified and requires confirmation from the client.
    \item \textbf{Agreed}: The client accepts the proposed changes.
    \item \textbf{Refused}: The client rejects the changes, and the maintenance continues according to the previous agreement.
    \item \textbf{Task Canceled}: The client cancels the specific task that triggered the maintenance change.
    \item \textbf{Maintenance Canceled}: The client terminates the entire maintenance process.
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Status flow chart of a maintenance change}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/MaintenanceChange/StatusDiagram}
  \label{fig:maintenanceChangeFlowChart}
\end{figure}


The transitions between these statuses, as shown in \ref{fig:maintenanceChangeFlowChart}, describe how the process evolves depending on the client's decision.

\subsection{Maintenance Task Status} 

Each maintenance process is composed of individual tasks, which represent the specific operations that mechanics must perform. To ensure proper tracking and accountability, every task follows a defined workflow of statuses that describe its current stage, from creation and approval to execution and completion.

The \textit{maintenance task status} includes the following stages:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Wait Approval}: Initial status when the task is created and requires client validation.
\item \textbf{Wait Assignment}: The client has approved the task, no additional parts are needed (or they are available in stock), but the task has not yet been assigned to a mechanic.
\item \textbf{Invalid}: The client rejects the task, and it is removed from the workflow.
\item \textbf{Assigned}: The task is assigned to a mechanic and is ready to be executed.
\item \textbf{Concluded}: The mechanic completes the task successfully.
\item \textbf{Changed}: The mechanic identifies an issue during execution and suggests a modification that requires client approval.
\item \textbf{Wait Part}: The task is approved by the client but cannot be completed until the necessary parts, not currently in inventory, become available.
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Status flow chart of a maintenance task}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/MaintenanceTask/StatusDiagram}
  \label{fig:maintenanceTaskFlowChart}
\end{figure}

The task workflow shown in \ref{fig:maintenanceTaskFlowChart} highlights the possible transitions between these statuses:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Wait Approval} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Invalid}: If the client rejects the task.
\item \textbf{Wait Approval} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Wait Assignment}: If the client approves and no external parts are required.
\item \textbf{Wait Approval} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Wait Part}: If the client approves but required parts are not available in stock.
\item \textbf{Wait Assignment} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Assigned}: Once a mechanic is assigned to the task.
\item \textbf{Assigned} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Concluded}: When the mechanic completes the task.
\item \textbf{Assigned} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Changed}: If the mechanic identifies an issue and suggests a change, requiring renewed client approval.
\item \textbf{Changed} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Assigned}: After the suggested change is approved by the client.
\item \textbf{Changed} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Wait Part}: After the suggested change is approved by the client, but the required part is not available in stock.
\item \textbf{Wait Part} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Wait Assignment}: After the part arrive at the warehouse and the task is not yet assigned. 
\item \textbf{Wait Part} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Assigned}: After the part arrive at the warehouse and the task is already assigned. 

\end{itemize}

In practice, the entry point of this workflow depends on the maintenance context. If the dealership skips the evaluation, tasks may begin directly in the \textbf{Concluded} state. In contrast, at a dealership, tasks typically originate from the workshop manager or during the initial vehicle evaluation, as illustrated in \ref{fig:maintenanceTaskUseCase}. In this case, the workflow starts in \textbf{Wait Approval}, followed by the client's decision and subsequent progression through the task statuses until completion. This structured approach ensures flexibility while maintaining a standardized flow across different maintenance scenarios.



\begin{figure}[h]

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/MaintenanceTask/UseCaseStatus}
  \label{fig:maintenanceTaskUseCase}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Purchase Status} 

In order to keep maintenance workflows uninterrupted, parts and materials often need to be acquired through a structured purchasing process. This process ensures that requests are validated, assigned, tracked, and properly registered once the items arrive. To guarantee accountability, the purchase workflow is modeled with a set of statuses that represent each step, from the initial request to its completion.

The \textit{purchase status} is defined by the following stages:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Wait Approval}: Initial status when a purchase request is submitted and awaits validation by the workshop manager.
\item \textbf{Invalid}: The request is rejected by the workshop manager and removed from the workflow.
\item \textbf{Assigned}: The request is approved and assigned to a warehouse operator.
\item \textbf{Wait Arrival}: The operator has contacted the supplier and is awaiting delivery of the requested parts.
\item \textbf{Finished}: The parts have arrived at the dealership and are registered into the system.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Status flow chart of a purchase}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/Purchase/StatusDiagram}
  \label{fig:purchaseFlowChart}
\end{figure}

The status transitions illustrated in \ref{fig:purchaseFlowChart} highlight the sequence of steps in a purchase workflow:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Wait Approval} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Invalid}: If the workshop manager rejects the request.
\item \textbf{Wait Approval} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Assigned}: If the request is approved.
\item \textbf{Assigned} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Wait Arrival}: After the operator contacts the supplier and logs the expected delivery.
\item \textbf{Wait Arrival} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Finished}: Once the parts arrive and are recorded in the system.
\end{itemize}


As shown in \ref{fig:purchaseUseCase}, the use case flow chart provides further detail by illustrating how purchase requests are initiated, validated, and completed. This structured process ensures that all acquisitions are traceable and properly integrated into the dealership's inventory.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Status/Purchase/UseCaseStatus}
  \label{fig:purchaseUseCase}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Owner Partnership Status} 

To extend maintenance services beyond individual clients, dealerships may establish partnerships with organizations that own and manage vehicle fleets. The process is modeled through a simple status flow that tracks partnership requests and decisions.

The \textit{owner partnership status} consists of the following stages:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Request}: Initial state when a new entity submits a request to establish a partnership with the dealership.
\item \textbf{Accept}: The dealership approves the request, gaining access to the entity's vehicle information and authorization to schedule maintenance.
\item \textbf{Denied}: The dealership rejects the partnership request, ending the process.
