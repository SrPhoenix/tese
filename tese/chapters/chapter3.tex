\section{Applications Workflow}

After the development of the use cases, a flow chart was designed to understand the users' interaction with the system and each other. The chart is visible in figure \ref{fig:figure2}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Use Case Flow Chart of the Client, Receptionist, Mechanic, Warehouse Operator, and Administrator.}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/UseCaseDiagram}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

The system's main flow starts when a Client arrives at the dealership for vehicle maintenance. 
The receptionist gets some input from the client and decides on an initial budget and check-out date agreed with him and inserts the information in the system (Use Case 1.1).
After that, a worker will be responsible for doing the analysis of the vehicle. 
He will add to the system all the problems he finds and the necessary parts that need to be replaced (Use Case 2.2 and 2.3).


If the budget to complete the work or the expected time changes, an alert is sent to the receptionist to inform the Client (Use Case 1.4). 
The result of this interaction must be "authorize the changes and continue the work", "not authorize the changes but continue as initially agreed" or "not authorizing the changes and wanting to check out the vehicle".
In the last case, the vehicle is delivered and the app will request the client to rate the service (Use Case 1.2 and 5.3). 
In any other case, the maintenance process continues. The only difference is the maintenance process information is alterated in the not authorized case.

After this step, the admin will receive a notification of the new tasks and will assign them to each worker (Use Case 4.5).
From there on, the maintenance process can or can not require the need for a vehicle part to be replaced. 
In the negative case the vehicle goes to the responsible mechanic to do the oil change, tire change, wash, etc (Use Case 2.6). 
In the affirmative case, the Warehouse Operator will check if the parts the mechanic requested are available in stock. 
If it does, the operator accepts the request and delivers the parts to the mechanic, who will replace the parts of the vehicle, deliver the damaged parts to the warehouse, and do the maintenance (Use Case 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6). 
If it does not, the operator needs to buy new parts from the supplier. 
In this case, he initiates a new requesting purchase that can be authorized by the admin. 
In the optimal case, the admin accepts the purchase, the operator buys the new parts, registers them in the system, and delivers them to the mechanic. 
In the worst scenario, the admin rejects the purchase and the mechanic needs to request new parts and restart the process (Use Case 2.3).    

Finally, when the vehicle maintenance is finished, the mechanic inserts into the system all operations and tests carried out as well as their results (Use Case 2.7). 
At once, the system notifies the customer that the vehicle is ready for the check out and, when the receptionist delivers the vehicle to the Customer, the client application asks to rate the system (Use Case 5.2, 1.2 and 5.3).

There are also a few secondary flows visible in the figure \ref{fig:figure2}. 
These flows are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The client enters the application to check the status of the maintenance (Use case 5.1);
  \item The mechanic enters the application to view the task he has to do (Use Case 2.1); 
  \item The Warehouse Operator enters the application to visualize the diverse parts and components in the warehouse (Use case 3.1); 
  \item The Admin enters the application to assign roles and/or permissions to the employees (Use Case 4.4); 
  \item The Admin enters the application to gather information about a maintenance performed and see statistics about that information (Use Case 4.2 and 4.3); 
\end{itemize}

In this section i will describe the dabase structure i create to solve this problem.
To solve this problem i create a structure that devides in 5 sections:
- Maintenance & Tasks
- Parts & Inventory
- Purchasing
- Services
- Vehicles & Owners
- Users

The section users was provided by the ligthmobie's dabase structure and i used it to create users, create the roles of the users and create the group of users (client, rececionist, warehouse manager,...).
