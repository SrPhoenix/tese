   abstract = {User resistance is a complex phenomenon long viewed as a major constraint in successful information technology implementation. User resistance, which can vary between passive and active, could be a source of guidance towards reducing problems associated with organisational change. However, rather than embracing user resistance and seeing it as a learning opportunity and a tool for managing current and future difficulties around user resistance, organisations fear it. There exist a wide literature on user resistance spanning decades; focusing separately on user resistance, and various related factors. However, there is no comprehensive overview of the research work published. This study presents a comprehensive literature review to gain a better understanding of the contents of the current user resistance literature. Based on the findings from the literature review, areas of concern and the impact of user resistance on the development of new information technology are identified and how to overcome the resistance is suggested.}
